1. Verify Hostname Resolution
Run the following commands to check if pes2ug22cs647 resolves correctly:

bash
Copy code
ping pes2ug22cs647
nslookup pes2ug22cs647
If both commands fail:

Add an entry in your /etc/hosts file to map the hostname to the broker's IP address.
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/hosts
Add a line like:
css
Copy code
<IP address of Kafka broker> pes2ug22cs647
Replace <IP address of Kafka broker> with the actual IP.
Save and exit the editor (Ctrl+O, then Ctrl+X).

make changes to fluentd.conf file to change path of the log files where log is stored.
